= Statement =

The purpose of the project is to create a set of SQL scripts that contain the 
usual list of countries that used in applications, web sites etc. that have 
a database back-end.

Also it provides the country flags used for these together with country names
in different languages.

I have looked over various sources from the web and gathered this data and put
it in a friendly, reusable format.

= How to use =

There is a directory for each database type, containing SQL script files each
with one table (for instance MySQL scripts are within mysql/ directory)

The following SQL scripts are defined:
  * geo_languages.sql - contains table geo_languages with all ISO 639-1 
                        and ISO 639-2 languages
  * geo_countries.sql - contains table geo_countries with world countries,
                        ISO 3166-1 codes and their name in English
