= Statement =

The purpose of the project is to create a set of SQL scripts that contain the 
usual list of countries that used in applications, web sites etc. that have 
a database back-end.

Also it provides the country flags used for these together with country names
in different languages.

I have looked over various sources from the web and gathered this data and put
it in a friendly, reusable format.

= How to use =
	* These files were created for MySQL database server, but can be adapted
	for other DBMS.
	
	* Import the countries.sql into MySQL and customize to your needs
	* I have added the column active so you can enable/disable countries from
	a list using SELECT * FROM countries WHERE enabled = 1
	* Put pictures whenever you need into the application and access them.
